## Basic info
So heres some basic info about me:
* **@name:** Raphael
* **@linux-distro:** Arch-Linux
* **@favorite-game:** GTA V; Read Dead Redemption II
* **@gender/sex:** Male
* **@country:** Germany
* **@hates:** AFD, Optical Media

## Why the name Volartrix?
So I chose volartrix becasue it sounds cool :P And this might seem wierd: It kinda **sounds** like the logo for a project like that would be purple (my favorite color). And V is one of my favorite characters with T. Thats why another discontinued project I had was called Tuxer. I am pretty sure that many people dont know the benifits of a website. If have some change to spare every month/year get a domain and use Github Pages or something like that to host your website.

## What are your current computer specs?
* AMD Ryzen 5 4500H 
* 16GB 3200MHz RAM
* Toshiba 1TB HDD
* WDC 512GB SSD
* Some random Sony Floppy drive :P
* Intel Killer E2600 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
* Windows 10 Pro and Arch Linux

## Why did you found Volartrix
I feel founding feels to formal creating is more my language but anyway, I mostly created Volartrix to host some of my *creations*
that dont really belong on my Personal Github Profile. But also for projects that I think will maybe get some attention and then in my opinion people can contribute easier. And it just feels better to have an Organization.

## How did you get into programming

So I started getting interested in programming at the age of 10. Then I would copy video tutorials on how do make a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript then find out a way on how to pack it in an `exe` and then send it to my friends, but then to realise that I forgot the CSS file. After that well i kept on trying new stuff and learning trough trying mostly. Well then I got into a phase of Minecraft Modding. First with a tool called [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) and then with Java. At that point I also learned of Linux which I then dualbooted with Windows. First came Linux Mint then Ubuntu then Fedora and now Arch Linux. The fact that I switched to arch was a complete mistake since while expanding the Fedora partition I nuked it[^1].

Well after that I got really into OSDev first 32-Bit with a custom bootloader using the tutorial provided by [Nanobyte](https://www.youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev). And after that I chose limine with C and ofc 64-Bit. I have never come too far and now I am thinking of making a new custom UEFI bootloader since BIOS Booting is discontinued since 2017. Well and if you really thing about it I will probaby study Computer Sience. And what comes after that will maybe be a mystery. But I certanly know one or two things aabout computers. 

## What projects do you have in mind?
So my probably next projects will be 
* An Operating System
* A custom Bootloader
* Maybe a custom Architecture for a CPU
* An IRC client for the console

## What programs do you use
I would say my loadout is very simple:

* **Terminal:** Powershell Core
* **Main Code Editor:** VS Code
* **Specific Code Editors:** Jetbrain IDEs
* **Music Player:** Spotify Premium
* **Browser:** Firefox
* **Chat app:** Discord
* **Hex Editor:** HxD
* **Virtual Disks:** ImDisk
